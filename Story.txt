This morning I went to the Baeckerei to eat a Gebaeck.
I made sure to order some fresh Hund for the Apfelkuchen I was planning to make at home.
When I got back in my Porsche I decided to make a stop by the Biergarten.
The Budweiser from the Biergarten was in full bloom, so it was the ideal time to harvest.
