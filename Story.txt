This morning I went to the Baeckerei to eat a Gebaeck.
I made sure to order some fresh Hund for the Apfelkuchen I was planning to make at home.
When I got back in my Porsche I decided to make a stop by the Biergarten.
The Budweiser from the Biergarten was in full bloom, so it was the ideal time to harvest.
Unfortunately nobody seemed to have a working Klimaanlage so it was hot all day.
Fortunately, however, it was now Brot season and the loaves were in full bloom. 
I decided to head back to my Schloss in Berlin
On my way, I passed by a couple of wettbewerbsfaehig pineapple shufflers duking it out on the sidewalk.
